## Test Coverage

The vignette demonstrates how to generate a coverage report for the package using the **covr** package. To run the coverage analysis locally, execute:

```r
library(covr)
coverage <- package_coverage()
report(coverage, browse = FALSE, file = "coverage.html")
```

The generated `coverage.html` file provides a detailed view of which functions are exercised by the test suite located in `tests/testthat/`.

You can also view a summary in the console:

```r
print(coverage)
```


<!-- ```{r cov, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
covr::package_coverage() %>% covr::report(file = NULL, browse = FALSE)
``` -->
