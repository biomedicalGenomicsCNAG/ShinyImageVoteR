\description{
Resets a user's annotation file by keeping the header row and the first
three columns (coordinates, REF, ALT) but clearing all other data columns.
Also updates the database by decrementing vote counts for all votes that
the user had cast. This allows a user to start voting from scratch while
preserving the randomized order of variants.
