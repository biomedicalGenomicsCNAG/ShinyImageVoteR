# The role of ShinyImgVoteR in the B1MG project

## Development of ShinyImgVoteR

ShinyImgVoteR’s development started in 2019 driven by various previous
members in CNAG’s ([Centro Nacional de Análisis
Genómico](https://www.cnag.eu)) Biomedical Genomics group before it was
made production-ready by [Ivo Christopher
Leist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivo-leist/) in 2025 under the
constant input of the group members Gabriela Aguileta & Miranda Stobbe.

## Use in the B1MG project

Users get presented a randomly picked IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer)
screenshot displaying a genetic mutation, and can express their opinion
on the shown mutation using predefined categories, confirming or
rejecting its validity, proposing that there is a different mutation at
the same location.
